**Essential Questions**</br>
**1. How do I interpret user needs and implement them into a program? How does creating “user stories” help with this?**</br>
Interpreting the user needs is the primary responsibility of the Product Owner. User stories help identify key componets the user(s) need to be implemented and it is the responsibility of the Product Owner to prioritize these components in the product backlog.</br>
**2. How do I approach developing programs? What agile processes do I hope to incorporate into my future development work?**</br>
First, review the user stories related to the component to get an idea of what the user expects. If possible, communicate directly with the user to answer any questions I may have about the functionality of the componet. Design a flow chart and/or pseudocode for the proposed component to share with the team. Build the project with all resources available. Agile processes that I hope to incorperate are the customer centric focus and short incremental deliverables to ensure the customer is getting the product as quickly as possible.</br>
