**Essential Questions**</br>
**1. How do I interpret user needs and implement them into a program? How does creating “user stories” help with this?**</br>
Interpreting the user needs is the primary responsibility of the Product Owner. User stories help identify key componets the user(s) need to be implemented and it is the responsibility of the Product Owner to prioritize these components in the product backlog.</br>
**2. How do I approach developing programs? What agile processes do I hope to incorporate into my future development work?**</br>
